# YOU GET ONE
YOU GET ONE is a MERN-stack game about scarcity on the web.

You can learn more from client-side readme [here](https://github.com/devinrbopp/client-you-get-one).

# Installation
You will need MongoDB installed locally to run this application.

Fork and clone this respository, then run `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies. I also recommend an installation of nodemon to run the program while testing.
